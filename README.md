# tinyShell
A tiny shell implementation in C

This project demonstrates a Tiny Shell (tsh) implemented in C, featuring essential system-level operations such as process creation, interprocess communication, and command-line execution. It includes error handling, memory management, and efficient resource allocation. The shell supports various built-in commands, ensuring robust interaction with the underlying OS processes while minimizing performance overhead.
